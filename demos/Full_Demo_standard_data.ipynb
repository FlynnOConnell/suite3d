    "## SVD Denoising\n",
    "We compute an SVD of the volumetric movie, and keep the top N components to denoise. This is done by blocking the volume to make it computationally tractable. The blocks have overlaps, and I find that for noisy movies you will get some grid-like artifacts if your block overlaps aren't set such that each non-edge pixel is included in at least two blocks. So, I usually set the overlaps to be half of the block shape to achieve this. Feel free to try with smaller (or zero) overlaps on your data to see if it works better (overlaps increase the number of blocks that need to be SVD-d, so less overlap = less blocks = faster compute). \n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD decomposition is implemented with Dask, which can be blazing fast (compared to other methods) if implemented correctly, but there are a few parameters that can make it really slow if set incorrectly. If the SVD feels slow, try playing with the `svd_pix_chunk` and `svd_time_chunk` parameters. If you really care about speed, probably install the Dask profiler and see if there are any obvious bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Dask SVD uses an approximate algorithm and its runtime scales **sub-linearly** with movie length! So for a short movie, it might take >10x the movie duration, but for longer movies it should be much less."

    "## Detection\n",
    "Now that we have a correlation map, we can segment the cells. The algorithm is similar to suite2p, it does the following:\n",
    "1. Choose the peak value on the correlation map, and set this pixel as your _seed cell_\n",
    "2. Identify the _active frames_ of the candidate cell by taking all frames where the activity of the cell is greater than a threshold (`activity_thresh`) or have activity above a certain percentile (`percentile`) \n",
    "3. Look at the activity of all neighboring pixels of the _seed cell_ during the _active frames_ of the seed cell. If a candidate pixel's activity is similar to the activity of the _seed cell_ (similarity above `extend_thresh`), include the pixel in the _seed cell_.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you've grown the cell as much as you can\n",
    "5. Remove the cell from the correlation map\n",
    "6. Find the next largest peak of the correlation map, take this as your seed cell and repeat steps 2-6\n",
    "7. Stop when the peak value of the remaining correlation map is below a user-specified threhsold (`peak_thresh`)\n",
    "Two main improvements over Suite2p: first, this is done in 3D. Second, it is parallelized to be much faster, as it works on patches of the movie separately!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most important variable that you *must* set is `peak_thresh`**. To do this, use the cell below to visualize the correlation map (`vmap` for short) using napari. Use the contrast sliders to find a minimum value where all spots above this value look like they might be cells. I find it useful to set the range to be very small, all pixels above the minimum are basically white. You should try to get rid of most of the obvious noise (e.g. artifacts at edges or around blood vessels, specks of single-pixel white spots, stuff outside the brain). It is not critical to exclude everything, you can be generous here and remove ROIs based on other criteria later. However, if you are too generous, you'll end up with too many pixels above the threhsold and your detection will take forever, with a lot of extra junk cells. I recommend starting a little conservative, and then push the limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other useful variables**: When you have long enough recordings, 0.2 for `extend_thresh` is OK. However, if you have only a very short recording, or you find many cells that are much larger than they should be (with large, sprinkly footprints that extend way beyond the cell), or you have large cloudy blobs of noise being picked up as cells, increase `extend_thresh`. `activity_thresh` and `percentile` work together, usually it's good enough to just pick one and change it. If you have few frames, or you feel like you have low signal, it's better to set these to be lower, so you include more frames when evaluating a cell. However, if you can afford to, it's good to keep them high (`activity_thresh` around 10, `percentile` around 99.0), because then sparsely-firing cells will be picked up easier. Play around and see!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make it faster to try parameters, you can run the detection only on a subset of the patches**. By default the movie is split into ~100 patches (I think), but if you pass `job.patch_and_detect(do_patch_idxs=(10,20,50,80))` then the detection will only run on the specified patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detection always works better with more frames!** 300 frames is a very small number, so don't expect it to work perfectly on this demo."
